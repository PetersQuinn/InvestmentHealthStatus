Welcome to the **Should I Invest? Dashboard** — built by Quinn Peters.

This tool was created as a fast, interactive way to explore stock risk levels 
using real market data and transparent logic. As someone pursuing Risk, Data, and Financial Engineering,
I wanted to showcase how quantitative reasoning and rapid prototyping can work hand-in-hand in FinTech.

This app is not investment advice, but a demonstration of data-driven insights.

Feel free to explore, compare, and question.
